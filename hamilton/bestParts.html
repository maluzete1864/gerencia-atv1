At how lucky we are to be alive right now
Look around, look around

History is happening in Manhattan
And we just happen to be in the greatest city in the world

<h3>The Reynolds Pamphlet</h3>
<p>I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
I love my sister more than anything in this life
I will choose her happiness over mine every time
Put what we had aside, I'm standing at her side
You could never be satisfied, God, I hope you're satisfied
Well, he's never gon' be president now
Never gon' be president now
Never gon' be president now
Never gon' be president now
Never gon' be president now
Never gon' be president now
That's one less thing to worry about
That's one less thing to worry about</p>
